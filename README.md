# MTE 220 Data Parser

The code will strip your raw ISS data of any garbage (for example the comment garbage in the first 39 lines) and return a file in CSV format. 

## Running The Code
- [x] Place your .txt file (The ISS.OEM_J2K_EPH.txt) file into the root of the repo. 
- [x] If your .txt file is named differently, replace line 3 from main.py with the correct name
- [x] Either run main.py using an IDE or you can cd into the repo and run the command "main.py"
- [x] The output file will be in the root directory and will be called whatever you inputted +  "_parsed.txt"
